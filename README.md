# Pyneapple: Interactive Jupyter Notebooks for GTK

I've been actively using [Pineapple](http://github.com/nwhitehead/pineapple) but its development seems to have stalled and/or been stymied by a bunch of bugs in various projects (which I've duly reported upstream). Since I use it as much as I do, I decided to re-implement things in Python + wxWidgets. This has a couple of advantages:

- No explicit dependence on daemonising an external server process, which may continue running in the background if the main GUI application fails
- Better integration with Linux desktop environments (at the cost of Mac integration obviously, but I use a global menu and the GUI hasn't changed all than much functionally)
- Since I'm dogfooding this for my PhD research I can be assured of updates (albeit with a slightly more painful than usual update path)

This was my winter break project of 2017/2018, and I may not be able to update it much until I'm done with quals. Expect bugs (although thanks to Nathan's excellent engineering these may be few â€” this project owes much to the original Pineapple).


## Requirements

I wrote this with GObject introspection (`python3-gi` on Ubuntu), and it uses a WebKit2 webview to access Jupyter notebooks proper.

## Running

Execute this as 

```python
python3 pyneapple.py <filename>
```

Untitled files will be populated in the home directory when File > New is invoked, or the program is run without arguments with no existing open windows.

As a `Gtk.Application`, `pyneapple` will automatically keep one instance of the Jupyter notebook server running, keep track of recently opened files, and terminate the server when all windows are closed (on Linux).
